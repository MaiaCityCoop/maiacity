# Working rules for agents in this repository

## The repository is play and the website (Samuel 2026-11-02)

- `play/` is play.maia.city: the sandboxes and the asset library, its site (`play/site`) and its API (`play/api`, Bun on
  Postgres). Read `play/SPEC.md` first.
- `website/` is maia.city: a plain prerendered SvelteKit site. No avenDB, nothing imported from beside it.
- `deploy/`, `docker-compose*.yml` and `.github/` are what the server and the deploys need.
- Everything from before (avenDB, theOS, the old app, the blog, the universe) is on the branch `SNAPSHOT_2611101`.
  Nothing here may import from it; bring back what is needed as code of play or the website.

## How changes ship

Changes go to `main` by pull request; `.github/workflows/main.yml` runs play's checks (`play-checks.yml`: the API's
tests against Postgres, its types, the site's build) and the website's (`website-checks.yml`: its types and build).
`main` is then merged into `production` by a pull request (`production.yml`: `Only from main`, and `Main is green`
reads main's checks for that commit instead of running them again). The push to `production` deploys play (image, DNS,
server, import, Caddy) and the website (its build into the server's `site/releases/<commit>`, `site/current` switched).

Before you push, run the checks of what you touched: in `play/api` `bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test` (with
`TEST_DATABASE_URL`), in `play/site` `bun run build`, in `website` `bun run check && bun run build`.

## Members

Sign-up is by invite only: an admin's invite link (`/?invite=<code>` on play, made on the members page) lets one person
in, as a traveler. An admin makes a citizen by hand. Admins are Maia City's owners.
